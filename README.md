# Building your blog with Jekyll Minimal Mistake

This blog is a version that I slightly modified from the Jekyll Minimal Mistake blog. I am using it for my personal blog: [maelfabien.github.io](maelfabien.github.io).

In this folder, you'll find the steps to build your own blog. Jekyll mainly uses Markdown, rather than HTML, which makes it really easy to play around with.

## Create a dedicated repository

Github offers hosting for your personal blog. All you need to do is to create a repository whose name is:

`yourname.github.io`

Github will automatically offer to host it. Accept, create it, and setup your repo in a local folder with the commands given.

## What file is what?

- `config.yml`: Page to change your name, profile picture, linkedin, github link, add Google analytics...
- `_data/navigation.yml`: Change the name of the sections of your website in the upper band
- `_pages`: Contains the pages that your created. Pages are made to contain articles or projects.
- `_posts`: Contains the articles/posts directly as Markdown files. 
- `favicon.ico`: Your favicon, displayed in the tabs of browsers.
- `index.md`: The landing page of your website.
- `assets/images`: Put the images you'll use in your articles there.

All the other files are default ones, have a look at them, but you don't need to modify them to get started !
